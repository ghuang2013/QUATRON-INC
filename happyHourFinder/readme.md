This is a rough draft for the Happy Hour Finder project.
Basic search function such as displaying the name and address of nearest restaurants is implemented. 
Advanced searching (search by happy hour most importantly), user sign up system, and comment/rating submission functionalities are not yet implemented.
Also, GUI is pretty simple and basic for now.
