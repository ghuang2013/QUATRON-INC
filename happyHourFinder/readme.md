Functionalities implemented:
1) Added search to our app. Our app can now search up to 200 nearby locations based on categories users choose.
2) Added pagination to search results.
3) Display the detail page for each search result.
4) Save the name of the search result in HTTP's GET variable, so we can build our database table based on that.
5) Users can also search for restaurants based on the zip code they entered
